user: Question: command to lost all files with .txt extension


Context: use bash commands
assistant: To recursively search for and delete all files with a `.txt` extension in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can use the following command:
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec rm {} +
```
Here's a breakdown of the command:

* `find` is the command used to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
* `.` specifies the current directory as the starting point for the search.
* `-type f` specifies that we want to search for files (not directories or other types of files).
* `-name "*.txt"` specifies that we want to search for files with a `.txt` extension.
* `-exec rm {} +` specifies that for each file found, we want to execute the `rm` command to delete the file. The `{}` placeholder is replaced by the current file name, and the `+` sign indicates that the `rm` command should be executed once for each batch of files found, rather than once for each file.

Please be careful when running this command, as it will permanently delete all files with a `.txt` extension. Make sure you have a backup of any important files before running this command.
user: Question: list files in current directory


Context: use bash commands
assistant: To list the files in the current directory, you can use the `ls` command with the `-l` option to display the files in a long listing format, which includes details such as file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and modification time. Here's the command:
```bash
ls -l
```
This will display the files and directories in the current directory in the following format:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Mar 1 10:30 file.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Mar 1 10:31 directory
```
The first column shows the file permissions, the second column shows the number of links, the third column shows the owner, the fourth column shows the group, the fifth column shows the file size, the sixth column shows the last modification time, and the seventh column shows the file name.

If you want to list only the file names without any additional details, you can simply use the `ls` command with no options:
```bash
ls
```
This will display the files and directories in the current directory in a single column, with one file per line.
