assistant: The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the remains of his cherished wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The monument stands on a high plinth in a rectangular shape and is surrounded by four minarets, one on each corner, which are themselves miniature replicas of the main structure.

The Taj Mahal is considered one of the most significant examples of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements of Persian, Indian, and Islamic architectural styles. The complex includes several other buildings, such as a mosque and a guest house, along with reflecting pools, gardens, and a number of other structures.

The main tomb is the centerpiece of the complex and is surrounded by four minarets. The tomb is a symmetrical structure that is topped by a large onion-shaped dome. The exterior of the tomb is decorated with intricate floral patterns and calligraphy, much of which is made from semi-precious stones.

The Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the most iconic and recognizable structures in the world. It is a popular tourist destination and attracts millions of visitors each year.
